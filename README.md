# IP-Firewall
An simple GUI that blocks out IP addresses inside your network. The program uses the WFP from microsoft.


The IPF(Internet Protocol Firewall) program uses .config files with it's own XML format 
to detect which IP addresses needs to be blocked. The folders are located in the %ProgramFiles% directory.
When the program finds out that the computer is connected to an other WiFi network than familiar, it will
automatically create a new .config for the WiFi profile. 

You can add IP addresses to the blocked list with a simple click of a button or allow
IP addresses again.

The IP filtering is provided by the WFP (Windows Filtering Platform) from microsoft.
